<p>Hi there! Thank you for stopping by my blog/portfolio. I often publish the projects I have been working on over here. I also post articles about some 
    basic programming and data analysis concepts as a way to really teach myself these things, so you may see some posts about those here often too. 
    If you think what I am doing here is cool and would like to get in touch with me about anything, please feel free to shoot me an email, connect 
    with me on LinkedIn, or check out my code on GitHub too. Click one of the buttons below to do this!</p>

<p>ok bye!</p>
