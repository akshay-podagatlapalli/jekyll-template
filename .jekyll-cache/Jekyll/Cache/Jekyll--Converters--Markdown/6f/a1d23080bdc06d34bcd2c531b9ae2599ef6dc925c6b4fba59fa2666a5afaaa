<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of unsupervised neural networks that falls under the purview of deep learning models. They are commonly used in the image-processing domain to create art <b>[https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251267/ai-art-gans-mario-klingemann-auction-sothebys-technology][1]</b>, music <b>[2]</b>, or to improve the quality of low-resolution images/videos <b>[3]</b>. Recently, researchers at the University of Toronto used their applications in biochemistry and medical studies to generate 30,000 designs for six different new compounds that were found to imitate drug-like properties and target a protein involved in fibrosis <b>[4]</b>. I trained a GAN model to generate fake Pok√©mon.</p>
